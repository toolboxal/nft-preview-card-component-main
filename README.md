## Process

Establish 'main' with a height.
Center card.
Contents of card set using one column grid.

## What i learnt from this project

By default, all the contents in the card grid will be block like. So when hovering near, not over, the product title, it changes color. Not the desired effect.
Justify-self: the product title to 'start' so that only when hovering exactly over the text does the color change.
